# ML_AI_Nuclear_Fission

![Nuclear Fission](nuclear_fission.jpg)

This project is an attempt to harness the power of artificial intelligence for modeling nuclear fission. A neural network algorithm was employed to predict the probability of nuclear fission based on the state of the nucleus. The algorithm was trained on a dataset containing nucleus states and their corresponding fission probabilities. The next step involves testing the algorithm on a separate test dataset to evaluate its capability to accurately estimate fission probabilities.

## Algorithms

In this project, a neural network algorithm was utilized. Artificial neural networks are a type of machine learning algorithm inspired by the human brain. The neural network consists of multiple nodes, known as neurons, interconnected with each other. Neurons are linked by weights, which are adjusted during the learning process. When presented with data, the neural network is trained to predict an output based on the given input. Through the exposure to data, the neural network learns to weigh the connections between neurons in a way that maximizes the accuracy of its predictions.

## Distributions

This project also involves the utilization of probability distributions. A probability distribution is a function that describes the likelihood of different values of a random variable. In this project, the Poisson distribution was employed, which is commonly used for modeling the number of events occurring within a specific time frame or area.

## Mathematical Module

The mathematical module of the Python language was also employed in this project. The mathematical module provides numerous functions for performing mathematical computations. In this project, functions from the mathematical module were used to calculate the weights of the neural network and to compute the probabilities of nuclear fission.

## Future Steps

The future trajectory of this project involves further refining the algorithm and testing it on larger datasets. Additionally, there are plans to employ the algorithm for modeling other nuclear processes, such as nuclear fusion and chain reactions.

This repository is an evolving work in progress, and more details, technical insights, and updates about the development journey will be added in due course. The potential impact of ML_AI_Nuclear_Fission extends to significant advancements in nuclear physics and beyond. Together, we venture into the realm of harnessing artificial intelligence for unraveling the mysteries of nuclear processes.
